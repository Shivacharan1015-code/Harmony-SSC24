# Harmony-SSC24

This was my submission for the Swift Student Challenge 2024. 

It did not make it to the winning bracket, but it was a great experience building it. I was new to both the frameworks used in this project SwiftUI and SpriteKit and I enjoyed the struggle of learning them.
I am more comfortable with UIKit but through this project, I was able to explore a bit of SwiftUI. Looking forward to exploring more of this and other Apple frameworks and creating beautiful things.
